South Africa's \"peace mission\" in just 12 hours in Kyiv: 1) denied the reality of a Russian missile attack; 2) told Zelensky to \"de-escalate\" his counter-offensive; 3) alienated most Ukrainians, including those who witnessed the missile attack, as this headline shows:\n\n12.

Ukrainian stumbles upon a grisly discovery: a Russian that was beaten to death with a large hammer.

      "1. Dinner with Lord Frost last night was excellent.\nI got to speak to him after too.\nHe confirmed to me that Boris does do detail - Brexit a case in point. In fact during his speech he pointed out that Boris was tougher during EU negotiations than he was &amp; always well prepared. https://t.co/D8BLH8nJaA\n\n2. narrator: \n\n- so far only 8 Conservative MPs have defended Boris Johnson over the privileges committee report \n\n- that’s 8 out of 354 https://t.co/59avS90NAX\n\n3. I honestly don’t care if a bunch of Low paid Tory admin staff had a Christmas party. \n\nThey didn’t make the rules and the rules were stupid. People should have had the right to chose what risks they wanted to take.\n\n4. Join us from 10:30am on Sunday\n👉Smear attempt on Jeremy Corbyn's wife has backfired.\n👉Thousands signing up to campaign against Starmer in Holborn &amp; St Pancras.\nRegister here for the Zoom link👇\nhttps://t.co/N4uEjXQSVa https://t.co/GtAofQ5Ndg\n\n5.

Wes you do know Bevin wouldn’t be allowed to stand as an MP in todays @UKLabour\n\n7. Another Tory scandal... it would be odd not to have one daily now to be honest.\n\n8. I am surprised Boris Johnson isn't a lot slimmer, what with all the jogging he does\n\n9. As expected, David Van will not be leaving Parliament.\n\nHe will instead be sticking around, like Porter stuck around, and like Laming stuck around, until the electorate boots him permanently in 2025, pocketing ~$400k in the process.\n\nQueue the relentless indignation. https://t.co/SlzPLRjs4v\n\n10. Arise, Dame Jackie Baillie! \n\nFitting recognition for her dedicated public service. \n\n@jackiebmsp is a fighter you want on your side - for her constituents, for victims of injustice &amp; for the values that drive her.\n\nA remarkable individual with many more years of service to come!\n\n11.

And explains how Johnson caught covid. https://t.co/SASl6NyLDu\n\n14. The calibre of journalism Kevin O'Sullivan puts on display while interviewing @LizWebsterSBF on the rather serious subject of Britain's post-Brexit food (in)security is a sight to behold!\n\nWhat an absolute and utter feckwit that man is! 🤡👇 \n\nFull interview in thread below... https://t.co/ihoQPSCz2M\n\n15. 4,790 days after the Tories came to power, one of them has finally noticed the smoking hole where the British economy used to be before they got their hands on it.\n\nIt's like watching a penny drop from orbit.\n\n16. The BBC has been accused of 'revelling' in Boris Johnson's political downfall and being 'openly hostile' about him. \nPeter Bone commented that people at the BBC had 'struggled to contain their glee'\n\nI hate them all. I don’t feel hate is too strong, quite restrained actually 😏\n\n17. Newly-released footage of politicians and staff partying at Conservative Party Headquarters in London during COVID lockdown in December 2020.\n\n“Are you filming this? As long as we’re not streaming that we’re like, bending the rules.”\nhttps://t.co/yOua2amF1a\n\n18. During the pandemic, Jackie Baillie lobbied the BBC to stop broadcasting the FM’s daily Covid briefings, calling them a “hugely inappropriate use of public money”. \nhttps://t.co/BvxFdMFaAH\n\n19. David Van has resigned from the Liberal party https://t.co/LmFf90wkMX\n\n20.

Breaking: “Erudite new columnist who’ll be required reading in Westminster and across the world” files first column! \n\n\"I like cheese\".\nhttps://t.co/9ixfuaDLAh\n\n22. You're blaming Brexit for the Nottingham attack? You're an utter clown. \n\nYou just keep moving the goalposts. \n\nWashed-up presenter trying to be relevant with childlike political opinions. The offer for the debate is there, until then I won't bother wasting my time.\n\n23. In 2012 Jackie Baillie was caught lying after claiming Scottish hospitals had the worst superbug rate in Europe. The story led BBC Scotland bulletins that day. It later emerged that not only had Baillie lied, she'd used superbug rates from a time when her own party was in power. https://t.co/252H0cxxwD\n\n24. Jackie Baillie doesn't satisfy any of the normal criteria for her award. No distinguished ministerial career, never led her party, isn't respected across the chamber and isn't about to retire. She's renowned for politicising the NHS and opposing measures that saved lives. https://t.co/j1Mi4vgWW4\n\n"

      "1. Trust me, women are only interested in how you treat them, not your wealth and looks.\n\n2. Manifesting For a husband like him🫰🏼🫠🤍 https://t.co/wM3WWr5YQQ\n\n3. Girls that keep showing up in your life want you to ask them out.\n\n4. Men are really going through a lot outside here! A Bro needs advice 😱 https://t.co/I371udNUqG\n\n5. Argue with the wall. https://t.co/DChRziBnmi\n\n6. You Always Have a Choice! https://t.co/ZS1iBXYwXw\n\n7. why do girls get so personal when you reject them? like you’re not her bro, i don’t want you 😭\n\n8. Unless you lost direction as a man, never date a woman who has a child while the baby daddy is still alive. #SingleAndMingle https://t.co/UFuACTV1kG\n\n9. Here’s what’s real. There are so many good women out there. The type of women that men desire for lifelong commitments. The only problem is they’re never attractive. The good beautiful women stay in relationships because men know to lock them down immediately\n\n10. if you claim to be a Christian man, and you care more about getting off than you do about your wife's consent, pleasure, and comfort, you know NOTHING of Christ. You have no fruit of the spirit. Your wife is miserable, and you're clearly just bad at sex.\n\n11. Next 48hrs ❣️\n♈️: higher commitment but needing more effort,\n♐️: instability within a connection, emotional feminine balance\n♌️: good karma, wish fulfillment\n♋️: needing to heal/have more faith, more financial stability\n♓️: missed/delayed opportunities, more stable connections\n\n12. A good man may be hard to find but trust me, he’s not hard to keep. #FathersDay2023 https://t.co/UN6Fn3oY8U\n\n13. explain this https://t.co/vEnK6WRiWz\n\n14. -“I wish men had it worse in life”\n-Is a man himself\nPeople that pander to other groups with hate tend to forget that they themselves AREN'T part of that group,so i gotta ask:\nWhat is the goal here?\n Be viewed as“one of the good ones”? https://t.co/QHzILlwxO3\n\n15. Valid reason why you ended up dating a married woman 🤲🏽\n\n16. Would you allow your wife to go out in public dressed like this 🤔 https://t.co/1vWJNur2JO\n\n17. maybe i’m just meant to be single for life idk\n\n18. Men,\n\nYou can either get Sympathy or Respect\n\nNot both\n\nWhich one do you choose?\n\n19. Dear Men\n\nDon't be a simp to please random women\n\nWomen will cross a river full of hippos and crocodiles to look for heartbreaks and dissapointments.\n\nThat's how they're engineered. Let them look for your trouble.\n\n#MasculinitySaturday\n\n20. I’m not with Portable for money, says fiancée https://t.co/fE0lYqER6W\n\n21. I got pulled by multiple men with negative rizz who just stared at me  with quivering intensity and said, in quiet voices, things like “have you considered the railway potential of the austro-Hungarian empire”\n\n22. Divorce is unhealthy. Strive hard to make your marriage work. It's a joint effort.\n\n1) be kind\n2) be selfless\n3) be deliberately committed.\n\nAnd you'll lay a good foundation for it, during courtship.\n\nThis is why I hammer you young &amp; single people with uncomfortable truths.\n\nEnd. https://t.co/y5nXJtLMSH\n\n23. Funny how the “bad boys” are the popular ones with the ladies.\n\n24. If you suspect your girl is cheating:\n\n• Don't confront her about it\n• Listen to your gut feeling\n• Be prepared to leave\n\nDon't fight, argue, or mate-guard.\n\nInstead, check out mentally and move on.\n\n25. Too much men are ready to give away their purpose, success &amp; goals for little attention of a woman.\n\nAnd once they get it, they will realise it wasn’t worth it.\n\nOnly then it will be too late.\n\n26. Ask women “why are you broke?” and they’d tell you it’s because they don’t have a boyfriend.\n\nMen are really suffering.\n\n27. Men that marry must accept this uncomfortable truth.  You must continue to chase excellence &amp; be a success object to your wife.  \n\nWomen however do not need to maintain beauty, they can let themselves go.  \n\nDivorce law doesn't care, it will always take care of her.\n\n28. Women can’t believe how alpha I am.\n\nMen want to be as alpha as me. \n\nAnd liberals? Liberals fear me. https://t.co/V4WpmwuPDR\n\n29. Tell wifey it's over. You're My toy now https://t.co/LTuTEGAz94\n\n30. Loyalty is your #1 concern when choosing a woman\n\nHere’s how to identify if she is satisfied with the love you give her https://t.co/8CHlXSqh7s\n\n31. Why are wives this way? @MrsKevOnStage https://t.co/gDfD5ojmnG\n\n32. A woman wanting you to argue with her, doesn't mean she wants toxic relationship.\n\nA woman telling you that you always say yes to her, doesn't mean she wants toxic relationship.\n\nIf you can't show her that you're capable, without acting it out, then you don't understand her.\n\nEnd\n\n33. It's a movie, but watch this video and read a tweet I made about women, over 2 years ago. https://t.co/6e9J1SdP3l\n\n34. A lot of men can't praise their wives as they wish to, because them Don commit.\n\nEven me sef, I don commit.\n\nNa anonymity dey save me.\n\nNo woman you have had something to do with, will sit back &amp; watch you praise your wife.\n\nUnless she has something to lose, she'll ruin it.\n\nEnd.\n\n"

A Javed Akhtar would have written more impactful, better researched &amp; more suitably Sanatani dialogues for AdiPurush\n\nYou know why? \n(Not just because he has far superior talent)\n\n2. So Om Raut took his revenge for loud music on Hanuman Jayanti by making Adipurush 😂🤣\nhttps://t.co/xatLmsjvej https://t.co/sDPFxOCxZA\n\n3. Watched #Adipurush today. Had gone primarily to have an informed opinion.\n\nWhile everyone knows about pathetic Visual Effects (VFX) &amp; inappropriate appearance of characters (particularly Ravan in Spikes &amp; T-Shirt, Lord Hanuman), there were many other Irritants.\n\n#SpoilerAlert 🚨\n\n4. Back in 2004, Swades gave a much better, more sincere and rewarding cultural representation of Ramayana through this song than what Om Raut did in #Adipurush #AdipurushReview \n\nhttps://t.co/legzdCg2rk\n\n5. Yesterday, Nepal officially announced that they will not release the movie #Adipurush  in Nepal as Sita has been mentioned as \"Bharat ki Beti\". Today, the team of Adipurush has cropped that part from the movie to get it released in Nepal.\n\nThe birthplace of Maa Sita is a bit…\n\n6. Ravana a Brahmin, is widely portrayed as being an evil character, though was also a learned scholar. He was well-versed in the six shastras and the four Vedas.Ravana is also considered to be the most revered devotee of Shiva. He was not at all like this.\n #Adipurush #आदिपुरुष https://t.co/jub4lkmwLO\n\n7. Yes! The Damage is already done! \nTo know what's attempted by #Adipurush, u have to understand who was #Thor ?\n\nThor is a prominent god in Germanic paganism. In Norse mythology, he is a hammer-wielding God associated with lightning, thunder, storms, sacred groves,trees, strength,… https://t.co/yWqCN359Rq\n\n8. Valmiki ramayana is not tale which one can narrate in just few hours,the all animated films and other versions of ramayana took almost 2 parts to tell the story 🚩\n\nBut @omraut excelled his talent by telling the ramayana in 3 hrs with superb flow of story and without a single… https://t.co/5NeJYh1Bw2\n\n9. I predicted six years ago that there was a design to portray Hindu gods as angry, very angry. The process is now in full swing. Is the new movie #Aadipurush the culmination of that process, or is it going to get even uglier?\n\nhttps://t.co/e47EcVwfDT\n\n10. This is my Ramayana. Not that trash shown by Om Raut and the disgusting language written by Manoj Muntasir!! https://t.co/3EMtXcE79C\n\n11. 'Kapda tere baap ka': Manoj Muntashir justifies uncouth dialogues by Hanuman in Adipurush\n\nLord Hanuman is addressed as “Gyan gun sagar”, the ocean of knowledge, says ⁦@mitraphoenix⁩ calling out the shoddy justification by Muntashir. Brilliant https://t.co/hWAxlkizYa\n\n12. Found this on Instagram https://t.co/qk5S1mAwoG\n\n13. And we knew that 👏 @omraut is a genius and he know that every part of Ramayana. \n\nInfluencers and negative campaigns won't work if we defend with truth 🤝. Hello Darling fans, don't give up, reply to every negative campaign tweet and win the battle against evils. #Adipurush https://t.co/MSoXRPr226\n\n14. Om Raut - Director of Adipurush.\n\nHe first tweeted making fun of our Hanumanji.\n\nHe didn't stop at it. He then made Adipurush, which defamed Lord Hanuman.\n\nWhy did you do this @omraut ? https://t.co/Tqqn6NHCDZ\n\n15. Adipurush writer's shocking revelation\n\n#Adipurush is not Ramayan; we took inspiration but chose a different name Adipurush.\n\nHanuma seat and Jai Sriram song??\n\n16. Stop sitting with people who gossip about others. Once you leave, you are the next topic. In the Ramayan, the relationship between Kaikeyi and Shri Rama was ruined not Manthara who incited Kaikeyi against him, but by Kaikeyi’s entertaining Manthara’s gossip. #RelationshipAdvice https://t.co/PocjiYAKcv\n\n17. Shoonya. ZERO.\n\nDo not watch if you love either your brain or Bhagwan Ram\n\n18. This is the true Hinduphobic mentality of @omraut 🤬🤬 this is what he tweeted on Hanuman Jayanti in 2015. He has now deleted his tweet after people exposed him!  \n#BoycottAdipurush https://t.co/1saJ5GoIOp https://t.co/aznihqCzd8\n\n19.

The committee has been asked to submit its recommendations within 30 days. “As a part of the exercise and for having requisite consultation, it is proposed to have views of experts on the subject and the users of arbitration, prior to amending the law or if required, an original principal legislation on the subject,” said an office memorandum on the setting up of the panel, dated June 14.\n\n19.

CALLING ALL CITY FANS \n\nThere is absolutely no reason why the Community Shield at Wembley could not be played on the Saturday ! \n\nWe should ALL let our feelings be known to @ManCity , FIGHT for us to change to the Saturday or vote with OUR feet and Boycott the game !\n\nRETWEET 🩵 https://t.co/dwW1x4MgVz\n\n12. Out of the next 10 years how many UCL do you think we’re going to win? https://t.co/LucmsMnluG\n\n13. And this is why we all love Ally McCoist.\n\nhttps://t.co/dp67tBaDY9\n\n14. Michael Essien to @SkySports: \"Right now, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City are bigger clubs than Chelsea &amp; Manchester United\". #SSN\n\n15. Youri Tielemans: “I chose quickly because I knew immediately that I wanted to go to Aston Villa. Because of the conversations I had &amp; the plan that was presented to me. It all made sense. Aston Villa convinced me. The coach convinced me. The project convinced me..” #avfc\n\n16. Firstly this isn’t true because Man City’s domestic quadruple of League Title, FA Cup, League Cup and Community Shield hasn’t been matched in English football\n\n17. Dembélé: \"This season, we were really looking forward to winning the Champions League, because we have a good team. But we ran into several factors... Injuries, and decisions from referees. The UCL is special and if you make a mistake, you're out.\" https://t.co/1n1hOslXti\n\n18. One week ago, 20,000 of us made the horrendous journey to the Ataturk, whilst millions all over the world watched from home, all hoping to see us make history\n\nAnd at 00:17 on a warm Turkish Sunday, we lifted our first ever Champions League trophy. I'm still in utter disbelief 🏆 https://t.co/xhnQwl5w6F\n\n19. So thankful I don't have to blame other clubs for my club's mistakes because my club doesn't make mistakes. https://t.co/j2cI64L1Ht\n\n20. They really said Pep would NEVER win the Champions League again https://t.co/KQlT0MESjw\n\n21. Liverpool I am in you (and blind) https://t.co/6yszRSqry8\n\n22. Manchester United fans are so funny.. Scraped Top 4 with a land settlement trophy and they think they suddenly \"have a pull\" https://t.co/Lpjxg51bQw\n\n23. Bruno Fernandes: \"I show up with the same energy and the same desire. It is obvious that the minutes will accumulate, but I am ready to give the best of myself because it is a great honor to be here. Fatigue will have to wait two more games.\" #mufc https://t.co/zOEiZzeyQm\n\n24. Less than a week after City win a treble and the toxic positivity has restarted because a player dribbled past Malta player.   This fanbase is worse for the club than the Glazers.  \n\nHope this helps\n\n25. 🚨 Pogba: \"I was quite surprised when I came back to England, already with the transfer, they put a label on me. It was quite sad. But it's two clubs that I really like, that made me grow and I can only say thank you to these two clubs.\"\n\n26. Virgil van Dijk on the struggles of this season:\n\n\"It has been quite an intense season, with many ups and downs and people must understand that we aren’t robots. It has been a year in which I learned a lot - especially off the pitch, and certainly mentally.\" #lfc [the mirror] https://t.co/EEri5DwdWv\n\n27. Can you name the player? \n\nLet me know your answer .... https://t.co/X5dKwFoCAV\n\n28. All the people in the comments saying \"you need to win 3 in a row or 5 🤓\", care to explain why the club is selling shirts with the badge on then?\n\nThe winner gets to wear a special badge for the season, I thought that was common knowledge https://t.co/mylWILidUG\n\n29. Paul Pogba has pinpointed the reasons why he left #mufc for Juventus last summer\n\nhttps://t.co/IOn9idU5uh\n\n30. Big question https://t.co/zb5omvFGUF\n\n"

Florida executed a guy who raped and murdered a 14 year old\n\n…and the ACLU is screaming, crying, throwing up because they didn’t give him boobs with taxpayer dollars.\n\nThese people aren’t just “insane.” They’re evil.\n\n3. The important thing is that he didn’t try to defend himself; otherwise we could have had a real tragedy on our hands.\n\n4. And it lives rent free in your head.\n\nYou have been mad at him this whole time while he gained millions, a wife, and a family.\n\nWhat have you done in 7 years, my guy? Think about that.\n\n5. the interesting thing about this horrendously bad tweet is the amount of gay men and lesbians quote tweet/responding to it horrified over what this sort of negative activism is doing towards their cause.\n\n6.

They said he also mimicked a screaming woman\nhttps://t.co/WijRgi72IT\n\n10. @ACLU https://t.co/s2OCMmM2bl\n\nDuane raped and murdered a 14 year old girl, and a 38 year old woman, and attacked 2 others who he did not manage to successfully rape and murder\n\nACLU is defending the worst among us\n\n11. He raped and killed a teenager.\n\nAnd a single mother.\n\nHe's lucky his fellow prisoners didn't give him \"gender-affirming care.\"\n\nBy ripping off his testicles.\n\nGood riddance, Duane.\n\n12. This man stabbed a 14-year-old to death before raping her dead body \n\nACLA is concerned that the killer never got a state-funded sex change \n\nThis is also a perfect of another mentally ill trans person\n\n13. For context: Owen raped and killed a a 14 year old girl and then another woman in a separate incident.\n\nOwen's defense claimed he had gender dysphoria to try to get him out of getting executed, but state psychiatrists disagreed with the diagnosis.\n\n14. God bless community notes.\n\n15. @ShaolinMaster8 @BASEDFights The crime does not justify what happened here that was an in appropriate escalation of force and abuse of power and his “partner” is just as guilty for not stepping in\n\n16. Duane Owen raped&amp;fatally stabbed 14yr old Karen Slattery\n\nHe raped&amp;killed 38yr old Georgianna Worden. One of her children found her dead\n\nHe attacked 2 more women who survived\n\nHe wasn’t a woman\n\n&amp;no decent person cares what nonsense he believed about himself \n\nYou are a disgrace\n\n17. The problem with your entire defense being ‘whataboutism’ is that it doesn’t work in court. You cannot convince a jury to let you off the hook “because of all the other people you allege committed crimes but haven’t been held accountable.” You need a defense for YOUR ACTIONS.\n\n18. This is unironically the ACLUs official position https://t.co/JHkHmUrcU9\n\n19. @gertritude I feel like it's more than implied that he might have killed the guy since they just kind of show his body collapsing not any specific cause of death\n\n20. This is one of the most brutal Community Notes ever.\n\n21. For anyone saying how ACLU has \"fallen\" - no, they were always this.\n\nThey take the communist line and are in favor of whatever is worse for you.\n\nhttps://t.co/0DHVno6Kqg https://t.co/d8JreXBi9n\n\n22. 14yr old Karen Slattery\n\n38yr old Georgianna Worden.\n\nWere both raped and murdered by this man. \n\nThe ACLU honours him. \n\nThis ideology is pure evil.\n\n23. @ACLU We need to boycott the ACLU for this,  there is no coming back from such a horrifically uncalled for statement.\n\n24. @ACLU Good.\n\n25. Violent man who killed a fourteen year old and raped her dead body probably didn’t suffer enough.\n\n26. Nothing to be proud of. https://t.co/NJ6h7dybMm\n\n27. Oooo😳 it is not @realDonaldTrump\n\n28. He said he knew what SAVILLE was up too and then went on to call him a legend when he died. https://t.co/ZcRhd0RBx0\n\n29. @ACLU If I am ever in prison for heinous, violent crimes, I will be sure to demand weekly gel manicures, botox, and monthly hair color because otherwise it will be cruel unusual punishment.\n\n30. This is a MAN who committed unspeakable crimes against WOMEN. \nI thought it would be hard for me to think less of the ACLU’s work against women than I already did, but no, they test the depths they can sink to.\n\nhttps://t.co/v2nnLQEzDG\n\n31. Leftists are up in arms because Duane Owen was executed. He raped and murdered a 14 year old https://t.co/0W3dEdg5Zz\n\n32. Ah flawed process, false allegations of multiple women, of course he thinks it's someone else who inflicted pain on his family.

      "1. The Heat have interest in bringing back Max Strus and Gabe Vincent (@Anthony_Chiang). https://t.co/srxdYAcBWp\n\n2. So far, 21 prospects have received an NBA Draft Green Room Invite:\n\nVictor Wembanyama\nBrandon Miller (Alabama)\nNoah Clowney (Alabama)\nScoot Henderson\nKobe Bufkin (Michigan)\nJett Howard (Michigan)\nAmen Thompson\nAusar Thompson\nNick Smith (Arkansas)\nAnthony Black (Arkansas)\nCam…\n\n3. Beal, Booker, and Durant. That’s a lot of firepower. Tough to judge without knowing what the rest of the roster would look like. I’d still love to see a more traditional playmaker with them.\n\n4. Jovic AND Highsmith? https://t.co/ODaat2cTyx\n\n5. If Beal goes to the Suns, Kevin Durant has played on more super teams than any player in NBA history\n\n6. The question wouldn’t be who could stop the Suns, it would be who could the Suns stop?\n\n7. How far could the Heat go with a trio of Bradley Beal, Jimmy Butler, and Bam Adebayo? 👀 https://t.co/jSAQThsnxD\n\n8. When people wanna trade you for Bradley Beal but you’re better than Bradley Beal https://t.co/kccz0ef5tB\n\n9. Package discussed by Heat would be built around Lowry, with either Robinson OR Vic and another cap facilitating piece (Jovic and Highsmith would work). Number of draft picks is a question.\n\n10. Reminder that this group was the best offense ever and was inches from a title run. https://t.co/Knx2YiMihz\n\n11. Suns bench after trading for Bradley Beal https://t.co/91aZQyjcDk\n\n12. Indiana, Orlando and Atlanta are all teams the Suns are having real discussions with just days before the NBA Draft on the 22nd.\nWon't get into details but the Suns are working to build out this roster and potentially find a way into this year's 1st round of the Draft. #TTTT 👀⏳ https://t.co/GOjqCDxyhJ\n\n13. Wizards trying to get the Heat to bite on the pump fake it feels by adding the Suns to the mix\n\nEvery report has the Heat and Beal tied together like crazy\n\nDoubt Miami over-reacts, especially since a lot of this is in Beal’s hands in many ways\n\nWe shall see\n\n14. I can’t believe Celtics aren’t even trying man. Phoenix &amp; Miami both have two max players and are still trying to get Beal but Celtics said I’m good. Wyc gotta sell the team man\n\n15. Keep it simple. \n\nBradley Beal on the Suns. Yes or No?\n\n16. If that’s all it takes to get Beal — the Lakers might as well enter this bidding war too 😂🤷‍♂️\n\n17. Washington is in serious talks with Miami and Phoenix on a Bradley Beal trade, per @ShamsCharania\n\nThe Suns have emerged as a serious threat for Beal, who holds a no-trade clause. https://t.co/uexTZVn8fN\n\n18. Durant, Booker and Beal is kind of a weird fit, no?\n\n19. The Heat is trying to get the Bradley Beal trade done without including Tyler Herro, per @Anthony_Chiang https://t.co/LlAf11pLig\n\n20. When seemingly nobody else in the NBA world believed what the 2023 Miami HEAT could be, they did. It just took some honest conversations and a few other things to get there...\n\n@CoupNBA has the story ⬇️\n\n21. Chris Paul to the Lakers seems more likely now than ever tbh\n\n22. Remember, any Heat trade involving Victor Oladipo requires the formality of him opting into his 2023-24 season. Any Heat trade involving Tyler Herro can't come before July 6. Any Damian Lillard trade can't come before July 9. So patience is also part of the process.\n\n23. Chris Paul and Shamet??? For Beal? \n\nMan FUCK y’all’s “depth” do that in a heartbeat\n\n24. Hot take of the day but shai is over hyped https://t.co/Zr49aw6EjI\n\n25. If I were the Wizards I lean towards the expiring contracts + draft picks package Miami could offer\n\n26. Never felt this way about Kevin Durant or Donovan Mitchell last offseason or Bradley Beal at any time before… \n\nBut just like in 2019 with Jimmy Butler, at this point I’ll be surprised if the Miami Heat don’t acquire Beal now.\n\n27. I do not believe Miami is interested in Beal - from what I have heard. May be why the Suns are the leaders in the clubhouse. It's certainly not because Phoenix has a lot to offer.\n\n28. Trade for Beal without giving up Herro then trade Herro for siakam https://t.co/FrXWkPm3lq\n\n29. Which 3 should the Lakers target? #LakeShow https://t.co/q2L3fjqb7o\n\n30. Bradley Beal is still really good, full stop. He’s also owed $208 million over the next 4 years and hasn’t always been available. Suns’ trade assets are limited to Deandre Ayton, Chris Paul and first-round pick swaps….I’m sorry, but I just don’t see it\n\n31. Every Celtics fan SHOULD be furious if Miami gets Beal. Absolutely disgusting stuff.\n\n32. 2018 Chris Paul was still in full control of his powers. His midrange game was a perfect compliment to Harden.\n\nGame 5 against the Jazz he dropped 41 points, 10 assists, and 7 rebounds to close them out. \n\nPoint god https://t.co/QZMv7inbmd\n\n33. Suns in 4 guy going to be the Suns 4th guy if they pull off the Beal trade https://t.co/Ws64llNOrw\n\n34. Beal is gonna get to a team that only needs him to get buckets and enter back into that best SG convo with the quickness. Y’all really value winning too much during player evaluations. Lol nobody mid is scoring 30 ppg in the NBA..NOBODY.\n\n"

Central Delhi Ridge facelift with flowering trees Ahead of the G20 summit to be hosted in the city in September, the forest around Malcha Mahal, a 14th-century monument at the central ridge, will soon get a facelift with a five-layered plantation of flowering trees like jacaranda, gulmohar, bougainvillea, amaltas, and chinar. Delhi lieutenant governor (LG) VK Saxena on Saturday planted the trees near the gate leading to the monument built by Firoz Shah Tughlaq and directed that the plantation be completed by August 15. The plantation drive will focus on the side facing Sardar Patel Marg as it will be the main road used by visitors and dignitaries to commute between central Delhi and the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport, officials said. In a move to further strengthen the ecological balance of the ridge, existing natural depressions in the ridge forest will also be developed into artificial water bodies. Earlier in May, the LG carried out the plantation of cherry blossoms and chinar trees across three islands in Yamuna, located between Qudsia Ghat and the ITO barrage to deck up Delhi’s landscape.\n\n10. A glimpse at the Etihad Rail bridge that crosses one of Abu Dhabi's busiest roads Etihad Rail has shared an image of a crucial bridge spanning one of Abu Dhabi’s busiest roads. Al Wathba bridge allows trains to pass over the E22 Abu Dhabi to Al Ain dual carriageway and is a vital piece of infrastructure on the UAE’s rail network. Etihad Rail, which posted the image to its social media pages on Friday, said the bridge was built in just 13 months using about 10,000 cubic metres of concrete, 3,500 tonnes of steel reinforcement and scores of concrete beams. Al Wathba rail bridge, located on the Abu Dhabi-Al Ain Road, one of the main highways in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. This rail bridge stands as a testament to the exceptional infrastructure development within the Emirates, ensuring the ease of transporting goods across the country.… pic.twitter.com/60rgJ7Qx8q — Etihad Rail (@Etihad_Rail) June 16, 2023 It is just one of several crucial bridges on the UAE-wide network, such as the 600-metre Al Bithnah structure in Fujairah, Dubai’s Al Qudra bridge and the marine bridge that allows trains to enter Abu Dhabi’s Khalifa Port.\n\n11. Row over civic body nod to rename VIP Rd Raipur: Raipur Municipal Corporation (RMC) Mayor-in-Council (MiC) gave a nod to rename the VIP Road after erstwhile Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. The 10-km stretch road connecting Telibandha Chowk to Swami Vivekananda Airport Raipur is the most convenient route to reach the airport. RMC Zone 10 commissioner Dinesh Koshariya had brought the proposal in the MiC meeting regarding the renaming of the VIP Road, where the MiC members unanimously decided to name the road after the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, said the RMC official. In his report, the zone commissioner said that there was no official name of the VIP Road - one of the busiest roads of the city because of the movement of air passengers. Due to the frequent movement of VIPs to catch flights after the development of the airport, people started calling this road the VIP Road.\n\n"

Watch: Arabic-speaking Korean dreams of Sharjah visit Freelancer smitten by culture, literature and events at emirate’s Guest of Honour pavilion Seoul: Speaking in Arabic, young South Korean national Kahoe Kim has shared that she “dreams of visiting Sharjah”, after spending an entire day at Sharjah’s Guest of Honour pavilion at the 65th Seoul International Book Fair, which concludes tomorrow, June 18. South Korea’s special celebration of the emirate has presented the Korean republic’s citizens and residents, who hold a special interest in exploring and learning about Emirati and Arab cultures, a one-of-a-kind opportunity to immerse themselves in the activities hosted by the Sharjah pavilion, while also acquainting themselves with the collection of Emirati and Arabic literary works displayed. For Kahoe Kim, a professional freelance translator who studied Arabic at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, her keen enthusiasm for the languages and cultures of the UAE and Arab world has transformed into a deep love for both, and inspired Kim to adopt ‘Jannah’ as her Arabic name. Embibbing subtleties During her visit to the Sharjah pavilion at the book fair, Kahoe made the most of her interactions with a diverse group of Arabs who shared the beautiful dialects that define the rich and multifaceted Arabic language. Between reading through a selection of high-quality titles being exhibited by a local publisher, Ramsa Publishing House, and watching and re-watching several episodes of a popular Emirati television show to deepen her understanding of the subtleties of the Arabic vocabulary, Kahoe ‘Jannah’ almost never realised that she had spent her entire time dedicated to exploring the book fair in one place - the Sharjah pavilion.\n\n6. QICCA showcases Qatari legislations to promote investment climate Member of the Board of Directors of International Relations at the Qatar International Center for Conciliation and Arbitration (QICCA) Sheikh Thani bin Ali bin Saud al-Thani asserted that the State of Qatar has been able to promote business environment and investment climate in the country through legislations and laws it issued in the recent years. He added that such laws and legislations have given impetus to the economic development and attracted more foreign capital in a variety of sectors. This came during his speech delivered before the 16th Dublin Forum on International Commercial Dispute Resolution that was convened via video conferencing and organised by the UK's Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb). Sheikh Thani stressed QICCA's keenness to propagate the culture of arbitration and expand its use as one of the vital alternate methods for commercial dispute resolution, pointing out that QICCA has convened several events and international conferences, in addition to organising substantial number of professional seminars to discuss alternate means of conflict resolution. The Dublin forum is held to discuss issues pertinent to international commercial dispute resolution, dispute settlement and mediation with the engagement of a host of keynote speakers and experts from all over the world.\n\n"

      "1. Not one group fully respects Black Americans the way we deserve to be respected and it’s freaking sad to see…\n\n2. \"Diversity,\" as presented in the modern liberal framing, is *always* enforced through social engineering.\n\nPeople do not organically choose \"diversity\" and never have.\n\n3. the surrounding conversation around this tweet has really emphasized something ~we’ve~ already known: to non-black ppl anti-blackness isn’t the serious terror it is. at worst it’s a mild quirk, and is otherwise (most of the time) genuinely amusing to them\n\n4. @heroz83 In what world is lactose intolerance a white people stereotype\n\n5. Rules don’t apply to black Americans\n\nThe gate was probably closed in his face by a racist kkk member who screamed “White power”\n\nIt’s racist to not allow this scholar on the flight after he missed the boarding time \n\n@MuhhSocioFactor \n\nhttps://t.co/zdxb9tbnZo\n\n6. the day people stop referring to POC as “black people” is the day we’re fucking free.\n\n7. American Black ppl have this delusion that everything revolves around them but truth is nobody gaf, yall are not that important that we have to have u to show her success she's doing just fine (even better) without yall\n\n8. Because you and your ilk confuse \"accountability\" with wishing death and harm on Black men as a collective while never demanding accountability for any other identity in the Black community. \n\nEvery one else gets to be individuals. Black men are one giant Boogeyman.\n\n9. Comparing LGBT to the struggle of Black Americans whose predecessors were slaves, fighting and sacrificing their lives for liberation is a serious insult.\n\n10. @DezManian_ How did you make a video of Taylor's fans dancing and singing her songs outside the stadium about race? Americans are so weird yall love to pretend to be \"woke\" just to win arguments it's insane https://t.co/RAucfRFYqj\n\n11. Question, why aren’t there any black people on Vanderpump Rules? #PumpRules https://t.co/KaISyxEsqn\n\n12. New York City Venue Cancels Candace Owens’ ‘BLEXIT’ Event, Accuses Organization of ‘Hate Speech’ and ‘Homophobia’ https://t.co/hjFCNJwpIh\n\n13. @EverythingOOC Is geography racist now?\n\n14. ppl will see this and be like \"they could NEVER make this today\" while the episode is literally about white people's victim complexes over not being able to say the n word 😭\n\n15. This you ? 🫵🏾🧐 https://t.co/aJtZYSYHsI\n\n16. This is how every married white couple should be spending their Friday night at home\n\n👇👇👇👇\n\nOnlyFans: https://t.co/JhwZp2qcRx https://t.co/IZqgrpnTFe\n\n17. The same group of women who made fun of her abuse and said that she was lying but wanna preach about protecting black women?\nThe same group of women who said that she won't be able to have children or anything?\n\nMind you, screenshots that I have and that not even a QUARTER of it. https://t.co/gq79yBOSYt\n\n18. As a black person, do you know what i care about?\n\nHow good is he at the job! That's it.....\n\nThere are far too many other things to worry about apart from classing one incident as 'racism' so please spare the virtue signalling.\n\n19. It’s not that Black men can’t be held accountable. Rather, “holding Black men accountable” has become a euphemism for creating whatever egregious universal narrative you can come up with, while then demanding we remain silent without us defending or clarifying ourselves.\n\n20. Nap time...\n\n#BJJ https://t.co/jqXg3Beb0t\n\n21. I will say this again, saying the biggest artist in the past 20 years was loved by only one group of people is the most stupid and dumbest thing ever\n\n22. To write hard-working staff off as “diversity targets” is, frankly, just offensive racism.\n\n23. Slavery was possible not because white man sold black man to a white man first but a black man sold a black man to a white man first. Black man is his own Enemy. READ THAT AGAIN!\n\n24. trope that i hate: \"turns out they (white character) were part of the marginalized group they oppressed all along\"\n\nlike can you not? why are yall so obsessed with this one?\n\n25. You can’t ignore the difference between how a black and a white woman were treated when making allegations about sexual assault/harassment in the parliament. Yet another example of the systemic racism @SenatorThorpe has shone a light on time and again. #insiders\n\n26. why are black ppl acts like they're superior or the world revolves around them like bruh, as an asian irdgaf, y'all white and blacks are all americans and lastly why is it a bad thing to have white fans? y'all are just weird asf, let people enjoy their lives, dumbo!\n\n27. For example, telling people they are victims of systemic racism might be true, but it also reduces their odds of success. (Cortisol might be one reason.)\n\nIf you tell someone nothing can stop them -- which is NOT true -- you get a better personal success outcome.\n\n28. @123itsmeMary @shesbadass I had a white German professor ask me this once… as he was teaching a “African and Caribbean religions class”. I got up, left, went straight to the deans.. I passed with an A but never had to go back to the class… he’s still here teaching 🤦🏽‍♀️\n\n"

Death of BAMS student in Ghaziabad: Police probe suggests suicide, autopsy report says strangulation The autopsy report of the 23-year-old BAMS student, whose body was found hanging at her paying guest accommodation in Modinagar on June 15, has suggested “strangulation” as the cause of death. The autopsy report findings are in complete contrast to the findings of the ongoing police investigation, which had suggested that the woman had died by suicide in her room.

Amid delayed monsoon, PMC to continue once-a-week water cut till June end With a delay in the arrival of monsoon and depleting water levels in the dams supplying water to the city, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to keep the existing arrangement of one day water cut in a week till June end. If there is no arrival of monsoon by the end of the month, the civic body will take a call on whether to impose more water cuts, said officials. PMC water department head Aniruddha Pawaskar said, “At present, the civic body will continue with once-a-week water cut till June end. We will review the situation in June end. While reviewing, the PMC will check water availability in dams and rainfall situation, only then a decision to impose more water cuts or maintain the same situation as it is for next few weeks will be taken.\n\n7. Yamuna obstructed, plaint against mining contractor Rohtak: A mining contractor has been accused of obstructing the Yamuna’s course through an artificial dam and diverting the natural flow of water at Asadpur village of Sonipat district. In his complaint to the director general, department of mines and geology, Panchkula, Jaipal of Asadpur said that Zelkova Builders has a mining contract at their village, but the company had been indulging in illegal mining. He claimed that the contractor has totally changed the natural water flow of the Yamuna for the purpose of sand mining in the main stream. “It has dumped concrete waste in the river to channel its water for personal needs. A bandh has been created in the Yamuna with concrete waste by stopping/changing natural flow for transportation of overloaded trucks. The matter has already been brought to the notice of various authorities and officials of the irrigation department, but no action was taken,” the complainant said. “It seems that illegalities are the result of the nexus between the company and authorities.\n\n8. Borewell firms do brisk biz as city water table recedes Ranchi: The prolonged scorching heat without any pre-monsoon showers has caused the groundwater levels in the Ranchi district to shrink by several hundred feet this year, experts have said. The depleting water table and the water scarcity, have, however, come as a boon for the borewell business sector this summer with many of the business owners working overtime in drilling water holes. According to business owners, their companies charge anywhere between Rs 80,000 and Rs 1.5 lakh to dig 500 feet to 1,000 feet based on the water table. Ravi Verma, the owner of Ashirvad Borewells, said he dug more than 100 borewells between April and June this year. “In some areas, we dug deeper than 500 feet but failed to extract water,” Verma said. Other borewell companies like Choudhary Borewell dug 500 borewells between Bariatu and Piska More this year.\n\n9. NEERI will be told to do green impact study of Virdi dam: CM Mumbai: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Saturday that the Maharashtra government would ask the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to conduct a study on the environmental impact of the proposed Virdi dam on both Goa and Maharashtra. The chief minister said the state government cannot oppose the construction of the dam as the state can ask for 40% of the water for irrigation and drinking. Sawant said the moment discussions start on the construction of the dam, “environmentalists express their opinions”. “NEERI will conduct a study on the Virdi dam, and once the study is submitted, the government will examine the study and take the necessary decision.” Sawant said that if the state requires water, “we cannot say no to the Virdi dam”. “At present, we don’t get water from Virdi for almost eight months, water flows only in the monsoon,” he said. “If Maharashtra constructs the dam at Virdi, it will benefit the state (Goa) in the long run. If we get 40% of the water, it can be supplied to the Bicholim and Sattari talukas,” Sawant said. He said that if the former chief minister and WRD minister hadn’t pursued the Tillari project, today, the state would have not benefited from it and got 70% of water for irrigation and drinking. “We have to take a positive decision on the Virdi dam,” Sawant said.\n\n"

Heavy rainfall and the destruction caused waterlogging in several parts of Mandvi. In addition to this, 23 animals were killed in Gujarat.\n\n4. Not even a single casualty reported due to Cyclone Biporjoy, it is a major achievement: Amit Shah Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday said that it was a major achievement of the Gujarat government that nobody died on account of cyclone Biparjoy which made landfall on the Kutch coast with a wind speed of 140 kmph.

No lives lost despite landfall at 140 kmph’: Amit Shah after Cyclone Biparjoy review meet Earlier Shah along with Gujarat chief minister Bhupendra Patel had also conducted an aerial survey of the areas affected due to the cyclone in Kutch. By: Express Web Desk New Delhi | Updated: June 17, 2023 20:05 IST Listen to this article x Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday said that no casualty was reported in Gujarat even as Cyclone Biparjoy made landfall with a wind speed of 140 kmph. Addressing a press conference in Bhuj after holding a review meet, Shah said, “Not even a single casualty was reported because of Cyclone Biparjoy. The way the Gujarat government and Central agencies have worked to protect lives during the cyclone is a classic example of teamwork.” Shah added that the reason for reporting no casualty was that the NDMA guidelines were sincerely implemented on the ground. “Around 47 people were injured in the cyclone, but not severely injured. A total of 234 animals died during the cyclone,” he said. “Electricity has been restored in 1600 villages of the 3400 in total, where power supply was cut.\n\n6. Villages near Jakhau ports in ruin JAKHAU: While thanks to the timely evacuation, there was no human casualty in the villages near the Jakhau port, the fate of the village itself is not so good with total devastation from the cyclonic storm. Several structures near the jetty where fishermen live and also sell fish have been completely ravaged. Aashira Vandh, a small hamlet with population of 400 and barely 5km off Jakhau port is totally razed. Streetlights with solar panels also got extensively damaged in the gale. The village, however, has a livestock population of around 1,000 as all the villagers are cattle breeders.\n\n7. Biparjoy brings heavy rain to Barmer, 5k shifted to safer places JAISALMER: Barmer district has been witnessing heavy rainfall and flooding due to the landfall of Cyclone Biparjoy. As a result, the district administration, along with the Indian army and other authorities, has taken proactive measures to ensure the safety of the affected population. Evacuations have been carried out, and relief operations are underway to mitigate the impact of the cyclone. Since Thursday night, several areas in Barmer district, including Chauhatan, Gudamalani, Dhorimanna, and Bakhasar, have been experiencing continuous rainfall. The district administration promptly responded by relocating approximately 5,000 people from low-lying areas to safer locations, such as government schools and public buildings.\n\n8. 12 Expresso Top National and International Headlines of the Week on 17 June 20235:26 Top National and International headlines of the week transcript In top national news: After travelling in the Arabian Sea for 10 days, Cyclone Biparjoy entered the Indian landmass near Jakhau port in Gujarat on Thursday evening, bringing in its wake widespread rains, storm surges, and damage across Gujarat’s western coastline.

Saudi Crown Prince and France's Emmanuel Macron call for end to Lebanon 'political vacuum' Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday called for a \"rapid end to the institutional political vacuum in Lebanon\". The leaders met in Paris and Mr Macron had been expected to seek support from the Saudi Crown Prince to find a solution in the search for a new president in Lebanon. Lebanon has been without a head of state for more than seven months, amid bitter divisions between the Iran-backed Hezbollah and its opponents. The stalemate has caused increasing exasperation for France, the former colonial power that has close economic and political ties with Beirut. Lebanese MPs on Wednesday failed for a 12th time to elect a new president.\n\n7. New Iran deal meant to stop Israeli attack – Western official The key objective of the impending nuclear deal between the US and Iran is to stop Israel from attacking Iran, a Western official told Reuters. \"If [the] Iranians miscalculate, the potential for a strong Israeli response is something that we want to avoid,\" the official said. The Prime Minister’s Office declined to comment. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said that any deal between Washington and Tehran will not stop Jerusalem from taking steps against the threat of a nuclear Iran. “Our stance is clear: No agreement with Iran will oblige Israel,” Netanyahu said in the Knesset last week. “Israel will continue to do everything to defend itself.” US President Joe Biden and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. (credit: Iran's President Website/WANA (West Asia News Agency)/Handout via REUTERS, REUTERS/JONATHAN ERNST) Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee chairman Yuli Edelstein said on Saturday night that \"Israel can live with the 'mini-agreement' because there is oversight.\" \"Iran is a nuclear threshold state and is becoming soundly established as such,\" Edelstein said. He warned that \"Iran is gaining abilities [and] Ukraine became an excellent platform for testing them...We need to keep an eye on this.\" What does the expected deal contain?\n\n8. Iran's president slams Israel in meeting with top Saudi diplomat in Tehran Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi met with Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan in Tehran on Saturday, where he strongly criticized Israel. Saudi Arabia and Iran announced in March that they had reached an agreement, brokered by China, to reestablish diplomatic relations after seven years of no formal ties. Advertisement \"Only the enemies of Islam, led by the Zionist regime (Israel), are upset with the progress in bilateral and regional cooperation between Iran and Saudi Arabia,\" Raisi told Prince Faisal, according to Iranian state news agency IRNA. This handout picture provided by the Iranian presidency shows Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi (R) meeting with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan in Tehran during a visit on June 17, 2023. (AFP) Raisi also expressed his opposition to efforts aimed at normalizing relations with Israel, saying: \"The Zionist regime is not only an enemy of the Palestinians, it is a threat to all Muslims. The normalization of relations with Israel not only fails to promote security but also goes against the opinions of the Islamic Ummah.\" For the latest headlines, follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\n9. Saudi FM begins first visit to Iran after ties resumed TEHRAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud arrived in Tehran on Saturday afternoon, beginning his first visit to the Iranian capital after severed bilateral ties were resumed months ago, semi-official Tasnim News Agency reported. Upon arrival, the Saudi minister was welcomed by his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, with whom he is expected to meet later in the day, the report said. The top Saudi diplomat, who was accompanying Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud in a visit to France, directly flew from Paris to Tehran, according to Tasnim. Media reports said earlier that Saudi Arabia would likely reopen its embassy in Tehran during the minister's visit. Iran and Saudi Arabia announced in April the resumption of diplomatic relations with immediate effect.\n\n10. UAE says Russia ties are a 'calculated risk' in an increasingly polarized world Abu Dhabi, UAE CNN — Russia's largest economic forum, shunned by the West after the invasion of Ukraine, had a last-minute high-profile guest Friday – United Arab Emirates President Mohamed bin Zayed. While on a working visit to Russia, the UAE president briefly toured the country's pavilion at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF). Until Friday morning, most foreign officials listed to attend were largely at the ministerial level, representing countries that have played a neutral role in Russia's war on Ukraine. \"I am pleased to be here today with you, your Excellency, and we wish to build on this relationship and we put our trust in you to do so,\" Sheikh Mohammed told Putin.\n\n"

I Never Understood Why People Who Infatuated With Guns Don’t Go The Army!!!!!!\n\n8. Basically Biden believes that the more braces you put on your pistol, the higher caliber it goes. If you put enough braces on your pistol it will make it fire .950 JDJ #MORECALIBER #ALLTHECALIBERS #CHODECARTRIDGE\n\n9. @RepMTG No Marjorie, you are a LIAR☝️Since 2020, firearms have become the top cause of death among US children and teenagers, overtaking car accidents. They were responsible for almost 19% of deaths in the 1-18 age group in 2021, as reported by the CDC.\n\nIn no other developed country do… https://t.co/VLGwZsplQY\n\n10. The time to act is now!\nhttps://t.co/1OQHPvWRlH\n\n11. Give me thumbs up and retweet if you managed to make it through the entire life without needing guns\n\n 👍\n\n12. The Founding Fathers didn't own AR-15s or large-capacity magazines. When the Second Amendment was written, a soldier was armed with a musket that fired a single shot. President Biden wants to ban AR-15 style firearms and other assault weapons. The Founding Fathers would approve. https://t.co/8woQW2zg8A\n\n13. @POTUS You are lying by omission to disarm law-abiding citizens.\n\nAlmost no gun deaths involve AR-15s.\n\nThe vast majority of gun deaths involve handguns, and two-thirds of all gun deaths are suicides.\n\nMore people die from being punched to death than are shot by long guns of any kind.\n\n14. \"I am a trained veteran, I'm qualified to stand outside your child's school with a weapon to prevent a school shooting\" bro you were a combat engineer, if the school needs to breach an obstacle they'll call you\n\n15.

Joe Biden and his radical ATF gave gun owners an ultimatum: register your AR Pistols in a federal database or give them up. \n\nIn doing so, they have just created 29 million felons in their quest to erode the 2nd Amendment. https://t.co/YmwSSNKcC3\n\n25. \"Down in Philadelphia and New York, areas I know well, like up here, you'd see a truck pull up, pull the curb and selling weapons, selling guns, selling AR-15s.\" \n\nFact Check: This has never happened. https://t.co/kYivlVRO3l\n\n26. National Guard Annual Training is one of my favorite times of the year on social media. It’s when Soldiers get their best training for the year, and the civilian population thinks they are being invaded.\n\n27. People are making fun of him for this but it’s true. Just last week I went to the range with my .300 blackout. Forgot it had the brace on it. Round went right through the target and the berm. Round is still traveling as we speak circling the globe and it’s killed 5000 people.\n\n28. Do it\n\n29. @POTUS You jump to “AR-15’s” as if all of these deaths or even the majority are caused by them without actually showing that data.\n\n30. You'll ban nothing. \n\nCope and seethe.\n\n31. What do you think? https://t.co/PwqHuHWeJo\n\n32. This is the weakest thing I’ve ever seen. Is this range run by every town or some shit? 🥴 https://t.co/F1krZy5b4i\n\n33.

As a kit, Arif has shown his intelligence by being able to speak his first words sooner than his brothers and even sooner than average toddlers at the same age. \n\nWhile nari was proud of Arif, he was worried for his youngest son who wouldn’t speak despite almost 2 yrs old.\n\n3. That lady got two kids of her to deal with. Your child is not the only child anymore . You think she got time to be answering the phones doing welfare checks because y’all baby daddy on tour and you making lashes. Girl BFFR\n\n4. Pick your Mommy:\n\nNatasha Nice      or         Kianna Dior\n\n#SexySaturday https://t.co/a1o2N2vf16\n\n5. taina better than me bc I would’ve posted ari’s number right after that lmaao wtf girl, stop letting this girl do whatever unless she has a reason to\n\n6. When a bm go off bout the kid the first thing y’all say is “bitter” bitch these our KIDS 😭 especially if u ain’t no mother you don’t even know how it feel\n\n7. But my thing is- why is the beef not with the cheating baby father\n\n8. 😂\n\n\"Mom's number one on the music charts.\"\n\nWatch @KariLake's hysterical story about breaking the news to her two children that their mother has a top charting song.\n\n#81MillionVotesMyAss https://t.co/UFAlMN10Uv\n\n9. if anyone has my kid in their care and decides to block my number so i can’t get in contact with them… about my child? i’m going low. lower than hell. i can think of a lot of things 10x worse than what ari did. that girl would be in jail\n\n10. Does Bagg ever question why Ari is still pressed over Taina … this shit is getting scary\n\n11. taina is young, gorgeous and in her prime.. she could have had anybody, it’s beyond me why she got with herb and joined the circus smh\n\n12. Ari literally accused Tiana of abusing her child before. So wtf on Gods green earth would you allow your child to be back around her? I don’t get it.\n\n13. moral of the story, herb posted he was single some days ago i wouldn’t be watching no bitch baby! 😎\n\n14. I can’t imagine someone having my kid and I can’t get in contact with them. Exactly why I say anyone who don’t like me will never be around my kid. I don’t play like that especially about mine.\n\n15. I believe taina underhanded. Its always an innocent acting bitch.\n\n16. I see why ari called her the babysitter, but also it’s no way you should be watching a child knowing you don’t like the mother if you’re the type to do spiteful things to children bc of the dislike of their parents . Also it’s no way you should have the child’s mother blocked\n\n17. Ari explains why she decided to post Taina’s phone number. https://t.co/TxhWfwDdqp\n\n18. muted everything *** ****** related https://t.co/vWjlPyddlY\n\n19. people died and were gagged https://t.co/bQsgHQFeei\n\n20. “Good to know we both have daddy issues, Moxx.”\n\nNow he knows where Moxxie came from, he’ll be his family.  #stolitz https://t.co/Rsf3bbvDwB\n\n21. idgaf what nb say, im tired of y’all calling Ari a bully when it come down to Taina…\n\n22. My thing with Ari, Herb, and Taina.. or anybody else in that situation.. why do you want to be around a child if you can’t talk to their mother? \n\nAri ain’t a Saint but anyone who has her child in their care should be reachable by her.\n\n23. I’m not gonna lie I’m not a parent at all. But Taina is dead wrong. And I’m not saying ARI is an Angel but Chile why would you have her son and not answer her calls. Especially if the dad is off somewhere else. Are you insane?\n\n24. If a nigga baby momma keep bothering me, THEY BOTH getting cut off. “I don’t want her around my child” YAYY!! Take ya babydaddy back too! Tf\n\n25. Herb is the problem here but of course everyone is going to be mad at Taina instead lmfao.\n\n26. taina is trending &amp; my elder millennial ass thought yall meant her https://t.co/sK5y81UDM8\n\n27. who the hell says this to someone who’s dad died like 3 days ago. like i KNOW his midwestern parents who he still calls mommy and daddy raised him better than that https://t.co/aRx3o91Ol0\n\n28. anyone who don’t think Taina wrong have no morals. that’s that girl baby\n\n29. What did Hunter think when he saw Amity stand up to her mother? \nCause it was obvi their relationship was bad so was he awed at Amity for standing up to her? \nDid he wish he was as brave, that one day he could stand up to Belos too? (1/3)\n#theowlhouse #toh #tohhunter #tohamity https://t.co/tGT7q2yk2a\n\n30. Instead of trying to justify Taina, just say you hate Ari. It’s way easier. Because there’s no way y’all are spinning this bitter bm narrative. No one in their fucking life would ever have my child and block me from contacting/checking up on my damn kid while she’s away from me.\n\n31. herb left taina with 3 kids (1 that’s not even hers and she don’t even like the mama) on father’s day weekend he’s truly a menace\n\n32.

Axelsen powers into Indonesia Open final, An crashes out Denmark's Viktor Axelsen hits a return against India's Prannoy HS during their semi-final at the Indonesia Open in Jakarta on Saturday. (AFP) Jakarta: Badminton world number one Viktor Axelsen beat H S Prannoy on Saturday to secure his spot in the Indonesia Open final, but South Korea’s rising star An Se-young crashed out. Danish star Axelsen, who has won the tournament two years running, will have a chance to add another to his trophy case in Sunday’s final after overcoming India’s Prannoy 21-15, 21-15 in 46 minutes. “To be able to play final at Istora was one of my biggest, you know, dreams as a teenager,” the 29-year-old told reporters after the match. “So to be here now, in the final again, it’s just unbelievable.” Axelsen will face either world number two and hometown hero Anthony Sinisuka Ginting or China’s Li Shi Feng, who were scheduled to play their semi-final later Saturday. The hot streak of South Korea’s An Se Young was brought to a stunning halt by China’s Chen Yu Fei, ranked fourth in the world, who beat the in-form world number two in two straight games. Chen rushed out of the gates, taking the first game 21-8 - the lowest An has scored in a game all year - before securing her ticket to the final by winning the second 21-17. “In the first game I played more patiently, and I think my opponent might be tired as her tempo was a bit slow,” Chen told reporters. She will face Spain’s Carolina Marin, who overcame Thailand’s Ratchanok Intanon 21-12, 21-11. “I’m really, really happy to reach a final after a long time,” the 29-year-old Spanish star told reporters. “As I said yesterday, it’s just to keep the focus in the right way.\n\n9.

RFK Jr. was like \"bad_stats, I challenge you to a debate!\" and I declined like a coward\n\n2. Vivek is a rising MAGA star.\n\nYou will never hear this from Pence or Christie.\n\nhttps://t.co/8rtW8V7wg4\n\n3. He tweeted this and deleted it. I wonder why? https://t.co/xV2IX8RJeB\n\n4. RFK Jr is a Republican. He’s another Tulsi. Odds are if you were fooled by that Hawaiian spy, you probably think the walking 2x4 Kennedy is a good idea. You’re not very bright.\n\n5. Every generation gets the Kennedy it deserves\n\n6. The saddest part of the RFKJr getting some traction thing to me is that not only is he a lunatic with deeply dangerous beliefs about vaccines and stuff, but he is also is the author of the wildly embarrassing Rolling Stone story alleging the 2004 election being stolen thru fraud.\n\n7. Joe Rogan says he'd vote for Trump before he'd vote for Biden. Thank you Joe Rogan.\nhttps://t.co/qcEQxtTEx0\n\n8. People respect Robert F. Kennedy Jr for his honesty, intelligence, common decency and for his willingness to call out the system. He is the blob’s worst nightmare.\nhttps://t.co/GEObZjGpQH\n\n9. RFK Jr. says there is no link between HIV and AIDS.\n\nBut apparently there's a link between being an anti-vaxxer and being a dumbass.\n\n10. Forget debates, let’s have RFK Jr arm wrestle Biden for the nomination 😂\n\n11. Joe Rogan rips apart CNN when he tells RFK jr how they put a green filter on his face to make him look sick. Why? Because he got better in a couple days with ivermectin. Speaking  of ripped: these dudes are both in great shape.  https://t.co/ljZG3XoKYd\n\n12. @hfortiermtl RFK Jr. is one of the top two leaders of the antivax movement historically. If you don't think RFK Jr. is \"antivax\" you just don't believe \"antivax\" is a thing. So why bother playing these games with me. Just say you don't like the word.\n\n13. Even more than Trump, RFK Jr is the threat that the disinformation regime was built to thwart. Rogan has an audience more than 10x larger than any cable or network anchor. If that audience can be leveraged into a real challenge to superannuated incumbent, the gloves come off and…\n\n14. NetZero\nMeans\nSweet f**k all\nFor\nYou\nPeasants\n\nMake no mistake about it\nThey'll take it all\nTo (not)\nSave the planet\n\n15. Joe Rogan asked RFK Jr. how it feels to be treated like a conspiracy theorist by his own family, and his response was to give a short lesson on Albert Camus’s The Plague, the Myth of Sisyphus, and the Stoics.\n\n https://t.co/u4EzelW3YL\n\n16.

Big Pharma shill don’t wanna debate him though  https://t.co/6wfLoZCd4O https://t.co/vkHZ0QfUir\n\n19. Joe Rogan is a moron and a disgrace.\n\nPeople don’t think RFK Jr is an odious, malignant influence because “the media” or because “didn’t read shitty book”, you block head.\n\nIt’s because his advocacy has caused untold, needless suffering around the world while lining his pockets.\n\n20. It’s either Trump 2024 or America will fall\n\nRetweet if you agree\n\n21. Man @RobertKennedyJr is amazing on Rogan.  So sharp and insightful.  @joerogan needs to have RFK on once a month!!!\n\n22. RFK is a major threat to the pharmaceutical establishment. And it's glorious to hear him destroy them.\n\n23. Some sickening (pun intended) takeaways from the Rogan and RFK conversation:\n\n• Pharma and related regulatory agencies are driving America into the ground (agency capture)\n\n• 50% of the FDA's budget comes from pharma companies\n\n• The CDC's budget is $12B and ~$5B goes toward… https://t.co/sKUX7sSHMS\n\n24. RFK, Jr. is a Devil's WHORE Republican\nPRETENDING\nto\nbe a Democrat.\n\nTOSS him TO THE CURB!\n\n25. It is important to acknowledge the things RFK jr is absolutely right about.  Industry capture of government, censorship and many (not all) Covid19 policy issues. To effectively counter the parts he is off about, one should be honest about what he is right about. No namecalling\n\n26. The way to elect Trump is for @TheDemocrats to nominate Biden. If the Dems destroy their strongest #peace candidate in a generation (RFK Jr.) in order to promote a warmonger (Biden), they will vindicate the #MAGA narrative about their party.\n#Kennedy24 \nhttps://t.co/L0mXziSmeF https://t.co/w9Xu4OmVpG\n\n27. Robert F. Kennedy JR is a complete and total fraud. The guy pretends to be a Democrat and then attacks Biden and pushes his anti-vax conspiracy crap. \n\nCan’t wait to watch Biden trounce him in the primary.\n\n28. RFK Jr is basically a Democrat from 1990. \n\nToday’s democrats dislike this because it shows how far they have gotten from their former base voters who wanted to reign in military spending, hold Big Pharma accountable for adverse reactions, and favor the middle class over banks.\n\n"

A new study estimates that in the year after the Dobbs decision, America saw 24,000 fewer abortions.\n\nThis is already a great victory. That’s more than twice as many lives saved as we lost in Iraq and Afghanistan combined.\n\n27. 89% of Democrats support abortion rights, agreeing that it should be legal always or most of the time, according to the April 2023 NBC News poll.\n \nThat's up from 68% of Democrats who said the same in a September 2008 poll — an increase of 21 percentage points.\n\n28. @POTUS I strongly disagree! \n\nAbortions are the number one killer of kids.\n\n29.

From Mumbai, the team will take a connecting flight to Bengaluru and is expected to reach here on Sunday night,” SAFF project director and KSFA general secretary M Satyanarayan told TOI. With Pakistan's late confirmation, the stage is set for full-fledged action as AIFF hadn't planned on a replacement. “Football fans are eagerly looking forward to the action at the Kanteerava and tickets sales, which began a few days back, are on,” the official said, adding: “Nepal and Bangladesh are arriving on Friday night.” After much confusion, decks were cleared for Pakistan's participation in the South Asian tournament on Thursday when the team got the go-ahead from Pakistan's foreign and interior ministries, which had earlier cleared their trip for the four-nation cup in Mauritus. TOI had earlier reported that the Indian government had given the green light for inviting Pakistan. After the India match on June 21, Pakistan, who are in Group A, will play Kuwait on June 24 and Nepal on June 27.\n\n"
